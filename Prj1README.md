------------
1) MyCompress.c
   - Purpose: Compress a text file of 0s and/or 1s; strings with length >= 16 are encoded as +n+ (ones) or -n- (zeros), where n is the length of the string; other chars are left the same
   - Compile: gcc MyCompress.c -o MyCompress
   - Run:     ./MyCompress <source_file> <destination_file>

2) MyDecompress.c
   - Purpose: Decompress files produced by MyCompress, expanding +n+ to n ones and -n- to n zeros; other chars stay the same.
   - Compile: gcc MyDecompress.c -o MyDecompress
   - Run:     ./MyDecompress <compressed_file> <decompressed_file>

3) PipeCompress.c
   - Purpose: Two-process pipe version of the compressor to split the work of reading and writing; reader child streams source into a pipe; writer process compresses and writes to destination.
   - Compile: gcc PipeCompress.c -o PipeCompress
   - Run:     ./PipeCompress <source_file> <destination_file>

4) MiniShell.c
   - Purpose: Mini shell that executes argument-less commands using exec, wait, etc., including exit.
   - Compile: gcc MiniShell.c -o MiniShell
   - Run:     ./MiniShell

5) MoreShell.c
   - Purpose: Similar to Minishell, but accepts arguments in commands using parsing.
   - Compile: gcc MoreShell.c -o MoreShell
   - Run:     ./MoreShell

6) DupShell.c
   - Purpose: Similar to Minishell, but can run pipelines in commands using pipe() and dup2()
   - Compile: gcc DupShell.c -o DupShell
   - Run:     ./DupShell
